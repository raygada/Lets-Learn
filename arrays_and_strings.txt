*********** Arrays **********
-->When the entire data is similar type we can take arrays for storing multiple values in single variable
-->Every Arrays index are starting from the 0(Zero)
--->Array Internally Pointer Used.
|
|__>i.e.  arr[0]=10  ,Let Us Assume Base address=100
          ==(Base address+0 th index*4(Integer Data type size))
          ==(100+0*4)
          ==(100+0)
          ==(100)...//At Base Place Add the 10 value .i.e.Starts Always Arrays From Zero th Index.
---->With The Help Of The Index We can Modify,access the data of An array
----->size() function is used to find arrays length.
for Eg.
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
string s="Hello";
int len=s.size();   //size() function is used to find out length of the array.
cout<<"The Last element is :"<<s[len-1];///It will print 'o'
return 0;
}



*************** Functions *************
--->Function is the block of code which do something .It Will Executes when they called.
---->Function Is Used To Modularized Code(similar code can be grouped into single function and when it is necessary we can call them.
---->Function is used to improve readability.

For Eg.of Function by Passing the value.
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void printName(string name){ //Parameterized Function Takes name as argument
cout<<"hey!!!" << name <<endl;
}

int main(){
string name;
cin>> name;
printName(name);

string name2;
cin>> name2;
printName(name2);
cout<<name2;
return 0;
}

-->From above we can see that after the passing the name to function it gives name to us.
but internally it only gives to the copy of that name,after printing only name without function it gives the original name to us.because scope of variable.
-->as local variable scope is only inside the function 
-->And Global variable scope is available throught the program
