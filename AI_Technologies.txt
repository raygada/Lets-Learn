********************************** AI ************************************
--->AI Is When computers can think and do the things like humans.
--->It helps machines solve the problem,understand speech,and make decisions.
--->eg.voice assistant like siri or google assistant.
--->AI is the technology that allows computers to mimic human intelligence.
--->John McCarthy is the father of AI.
--->Applications and devices equipped with an AI can see and identify objects. they can understand and respond to the human language.

********************************  ML ****************************************
--->ML is the part of the AI where computers learn from data 
--->Eg.YouTube's recommended videos based on what you search
--->Instead of the following rules,ML models identify patterns in the data and make predictions or decisions.
--->The Performance of these systems can be improved by providing larger and more varied datasets to be processed.
--->Machine Learning is more explicitly used as means to extract knowledge from data through techniques as neural networks ,supervised,unsupervised learning,decision trees and linear regression.
--->Eg.If we want to identify the computer it is cat then we can gives them lot of the cat images and let the ML algorithm figure out the common patterns and features that define the cat.over the time when it processed more image, then it can recognizes better.

|--->Types of ML:
     |
     |-->Supervised Learning:
         |-->It is machine learning model that uses labelled data(Structured data)              to map the specific feature to the label.
         |-->Eg.Spam Detection.
         |-->It uses algorithm as-->Linear Regression,Support vector              machines,Decision Trees.
     |-->Unsupervised Learning:
         |-->it is type of ML where the computer learns patterns from data that                 without labels.
         |-->In this AI systems groups the unsorted information according to the              similarities and differences
         |-->Unsupervised learning does not need supervision,or pre-existing                    datasets while training the data sets.
         |-->It uses algorithms like Apriori,K-means Clustering,Artificial Neural              Networks
    |--->Semi-Supervised Learning:
         |-->It the type which is mixed of supervised and Unsupervised learning.
         |-->It uses some labelled data and lots of Unlabelled data.
         |-->Eg.Spam Detection--->Some emails are spam,AI detects more based on              patterns.
         |-->It is better than Unsupervised learning becauses it has some labelled              data.
    |--->Reinforcement Learning:
         |-->It is the type of ML where AI learns from trials and errors.
         |-->It gets rewards for good actions and penalties for the bad actions.
         |-->Reinforcement learning from the human feedback.
         |-->It trains software to make decisions to achieve the most optimal              results.
         |-->It Uses algorithm as Q-Learning,Model-based Value Estimation.
         |-->Eg.Self Driving Cars,Chess Game.

***************************************************************************
Deep Learning:(Deep refers as to use of multiple layers)
--->Deep Learning is the type of ML that enables uses artifical neural networks to     learn from the data.
--->Artifical Neural Network are the inspired by the human brain, they can be used     to solve variety of the problems.
--->Neural Networks are made up of layers of interconnected nodes.and each node is     responsible for learning specific feature of the data.
--->Deep Learning is the subset of the ML
--->Deep Learning automatically discovers the most relevant data to be used for     learning.
|
|--->Types Of DL:
      |
      |--->Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) :
           | 
           |-->It is Made up of the layers of neurons.
           |-->It is inspired by the human brain.
           |-->It Consists of the interconnected nodes that process and transmit                the information
           |-->It is the good method to solve the problems with nonlinear                relationship without knowing the exact function.
     |---->Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) :
           |
           |-->It is the type of the deep learning algorithm,particularly well-               suited for analyzing visual data like images and videos by                automatically learning and extracting features .
           |-->It Uses filters and layers to detect patterns.
